# NLP Projects üöÄ  
This repository contains Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects developed as part of my academic coursework in the subject *Natural Language Processing*. Each project applies real-world data and machine learning models to perform complex language tasks such as fact verification, news classification, and emotion-cause pair extraction.

### 2. News Article Classification
- **Description:** A text classification system that categorizes news articles into predefined topics using NLP techniques.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Google Colab, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, NLTK, SpaCy, BERT
- **Key Features:**
  - Dataset cleaning and vectorization
  - Fine-tuning of a hybrid classification model
